  - I seriously messed up, alright. This dude asked for my credentials, and I thought
    I could just pay to get the license across.
  - So what if I don't qualify for the expert's course? It's not like he would do
    anything about it, right?
  - Anyway, this prick just kept on jabbing about it till I started resisting arrest.
    It turns out, he was the county sheriff.
